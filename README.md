## NYC Schools SAT Score Analysis

In this project, I'll be looking at data from NYC Open Data on SAT scores for high schools in NYC. The data provided by NYC Open Data is in several different files, so I begin by cleaning up the data so that it can all be placed into a single file. Once that's done, I look at the correlations between SAT scores for a school and a few different factors like student/parent/teacher survey results, and the racial breakdown of schools' student population.

In doing this analysis, I'll be presenting the data in several ways (bar graphs, scatter graphs, and colour maps). I also discuss some of the limitations of the dataset that I use, and how it hinders our ability to draw substantial conclusions from our analysis.
