So, we need to add a leading 0 to those values which are just a single digit. We can do this with the string method zfill. This method will automatically check the number of digits in the number, and if there are fewer than the number specified (2 below), then it will add zeroes to the front of the number until the specified number of digits is reached. If there are already 2 digits in the number, then it will return the number as is (albeit as a string). For example, for num = 5, pad_csd will return \"05\". For num = 12, pad_csd will return \"12\".\n",

If a DBN appears in ap_2010, but not in combined, then it will not be added to the combined df. If there are any columns where there is no value in the second df, then the value null will be placed.

    "So, there are very few correlations which are negative, and none that are significant. The most strongly negative correlation is with com_p_11 (communication score based on parent responses), indicating that SAT scores slightly decrease with an increased communication score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most strongly correlated factors are number of teacher respondents and number of student respondents. The higher the number of parents that respond to the survey, and the higher the number of students that respond to the survey, it seems, the higher the SAT scores. It's worth noting, however, that the r value for these factors is exactly the same, and that number of teacher respondents is also correlated with SAT score. This may indicate that there is a common factor which is correlated with all three of these factors and with SAT score.\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, if we read the page linked above (survey data dictionary), it states that all students, parents, and teachers take the survey. Thus, SAT scores are not so much correlated with the number of respondents to the survey, but rather the number of students enrolled in the school. An interesting observation given that one might expect the quality of teaching to decrease in a larger school.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more interesting figure still, however, would be class size. We can see that as the number of teachers increases, the SAT score increases as well. Perhaps there would be a stronger correlation between SAT score and teacher to student ratio?\n",
    "\n",
    "Noteworthy also is that SAT score is weakly positively correlated with student's and teacher's reports of safety and respect. It is, of course, unsurprising that safety and respect total score would also be weakly positively correlated with SAT scores given this result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, SAT score is weakly positively correlated with teacher's academic expectations. This is certainly no surprise, and indeed we may wonder why it is not higher. One would hope that teachers would have a good grasp on whether or not their students are likely to do well."

    "All of the correlations we observe here are somewhat significant in themselves, and particularly interesting when we compare them with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a weak negative correlation between a school's mean SAT score and the percentage of hispanic and black students at that school. Conversely, there is a moderate to strong positive correlation between mean SAT score and asian percentage, and a strong positive correlation mean SAT score and white percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can we conclude from the above correlation? Not much just yet. We do know that students from schools with a higher percentage of hispanic or black students perform worse on the SAT than students in schools with lower percentages of students of those races. But, we do not yet know why that is the case. There may be a factor which is the cause of both a high percentage of hispanic students and poor SAT scores (e.g. the wealth in a particular district). Or, the hispanic students may perform unusually well on the SAT test, but the school's average SAT score is dragged down by the performance of other races (though this is certainly unlikely).\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is, we'd need to look at the data in more detail to establish such causal claims, and we may even need to look for additional data beyond what we have to establish the hypotheses we propose. This is a major issue with certain statistics - they are inherently static and information reducing. That is, when calculating something like the mean, we've got a new number which says something general about the data set (and was not immediately obvious when looking at individual entries in the dataset), but if we only look at that number we've essentially collapsed hundreds of data points into a single data point. Sometimes this is helpful, but other times it will obscure important information present in the data."

    "This scatter plot definitely helps us learn more about the correlation between the percentage of hispanic students in a school and the mean SAT score.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can clearly see that as hispanic_per increases, SAT score tends to decrease. Indeed, once hispanic_per gets to around 35%, there are no schools with mean SAT scores above 1500. As hispanic_per continues to increase, this number also decreases. This is particularly noticable once hispanic_per hits 100% (or near enough). For schools with hispanic_per of approximately 100, mean SAT score is noticably low, around 1100 for the top performing school.\n",
    "\n",
    "These data points (where hispanic_per ~ 100) are particularly interesting because they completely rule out alternative explanations such as the second one I proposed above - that the low SAT score could be the result of students of other races performing poorly. The fact that this is not the case is particularly clear with these data points. This is also further supported by school with high percentages of hispanic students. As hispanic_per increases, the influence non-hispanic students could have on the school's mean SAT score is reduced, because their scores constitute less of the data. As such, the fact that we see mean SAT scores decreasing as hispanic_per increases is also indicative of the fact that the mean SAT score for a school is not dragged down only by non-hispanic students performing poorly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can conclude that the correlation between hispanic_per and SAT score is robust. To establish a hypothesis such as \"ceteris paribus, hispanic students perform more poorly on the SAT than students of other races\", we'd need to control for other factors that may affect SAT score, such as a schools funding, the student's personal or family lives, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start to do this by looking for schools with hispanic_per higher than a particular threshold, say 95%, and learning more about those schools."

    "Let's just look at three of these schools: Manhattan Bridges High School, Multicultural High School, and Pan American International High School at Monroe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most notably, each of these schools offers Spanish bilingual instruction for recent immigrants to the US. This certainly explains the relatively low SAT scores for each of these schools, as it indicates several factors that would likely affect SAT score: language proficiency (presumably most will not be fluent in English, and the SAT is only given in English), previous education (while this may have been good, if the education was not aimed at preparing students for the SAT, this may affect their performance. It is also possible that immigrants to the US will not have had a good quality education prior to immigrating), and circumstance (immigrating to the US could certainly be destabilising, at least initially).\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have reason to believe that the correlation between hispanic_per and SAT score is the result of non-racial factors. Furthermore, the fact that these factors are likely correlated with race would explain why we observed the initial correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wanted to strengthen our hypothesis that the correlation between hispanic_per and SAT score is the result of these factors, we'd need to collect additional data, likely from surveys of hispanic students in various schools. We'd also need to control for race when investigating these factors. That is, the above three factors I've discussed may certainly affect non-hispanic students as well, which we ought to be aware of. Similarly, some hispanic students (e.g. 2nd or later generation immigrants) will not be affected by these issues, but if their SAT scores are still poor, we would suspect that there is an additional factor influencing their SAT score that we ought to investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we've gone some way to figuring out why there is a correlation  between hispanic_per and SAT score, but there is much work left to be done!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is much more that we could investigate in this data set, such as correlations between gender and SAT score, or school size and SAT score. These are certainly interesting relationships, but I'll leave this project here."
